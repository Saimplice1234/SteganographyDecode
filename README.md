# SteganographyDecode

Steganography is the art of concealment: its object is to make one message go unnoticed in another message. It differs from cryptography, "the art of secrecy", which seeks to make a message unintelligible to anyone other than those who are entitled to it. To use a metaphor, steganography would consist of burying your money in your garden where cryptography would consist of locking it in a safe - that said, nothing prevents combining the two techniques, just as you can bury a chest in his garden.
